=======
Say goodbye to Buypass with Byepass! Configure Byepass with your Buypass pin and location of Buypass and Byepass will do the rest. Byepass will enter your pin, process the password image and copy it to your clipboard before exiting.

To save some additional seconds, make sure to go to ` File -> Create desktop shortcut `. This will add a shortcut to your desktop with the argument ` -run `. Using the shortcut with the run parameter will start Buypass instantly and close Byepass right after the password is copied to the clipboard.
